> The UPDC has encountered an encrypted message drifting through the cosmos. Unsure of what to do they decided to hire you, a space consultant to find out if it is a potential threat to the UPDC or not. One thing they could decrypt from it was just a simple key in plaintext called: "PLANET". Your Mission, should you choose to accept it, is to decrypt the transmission and aid the UPDC in their efforts to tackle this mess. This message will self destruct in 3....2...1.

> The transmission message is: `NP5UNAZtMAcGRfQRLuTuMZyJQ0cEH0kMO1gvQZgUOZgJPgWSHeIYI09ERPMWQeH1`
> 
> The flag format is: `NexusCTF{<flag>}`
