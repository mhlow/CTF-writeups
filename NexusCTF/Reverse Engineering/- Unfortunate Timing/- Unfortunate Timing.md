> Us Beltway folks bagged sir goldpants here after his spacecraft "unfortunately" collided with our "weather analysis" missile. He has been polite enough to offer us his entire credstick, holding his newest paycheck, in apology for this most terrible accident. One itty bitty problem:
> 
> Axion Mining Corp’s latest security system makes their credsticks automatically reject any password if it can’t trace its owner’s biological signature in close proximity.
> 
> Unfortunately for our friend in management, he suffered a most untimely industrial accident when we “asked politely” for his key. That means his biometrics are gone — and the password check is now permanently unwinnable.
> 
> But don’t worry. These systems don’t need the network to run — everything is on the device itself. The decoder must still be somewhere inside the binary. Lend us a hand, and we'll give you a half.
