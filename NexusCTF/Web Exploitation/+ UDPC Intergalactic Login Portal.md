Looks to be a simple login page.

First thing to try: SQL injection.
Inputting `admin' OR 1=1 OR '` to **both** username and password (it does not need to be both) allowed me into the admin account and I could see a list of accounts 

| ID | USERNAME        | QUANTUM ADDRESS                | ADMIN | FULL IDENTITY         |
|----|-----------------|-------------------------------|-------|-----------------------|
| 1  | admin           | admin@quantumnexus.space      | Yes   | System Overseer       |
| 2  | silent_shadow   | shadow@marsunder.net          | No    | Kaito Yamamoto        |
| 3  | crypto_corsair  | corsair@asteroidbelt.io       | No    | Riley Vance           |
| 4  | neuro_spike     | spike@jupiterstation.gov      | No    | Dr. Aris Thorne       |
| 5  | quantum_ghost   | ghost@aethericlabs.moon       | No    | Elara Petrova         |

Logging out and trying with `silent_shadow' OR 1=1 OR '` as the username and `silent_shadow' OR 1=1 OR '` as the password (I was copying and pasting) still logged me into the admin account, which really confused me at the time, since I thought the username would be the one to determine the account.
Turns out that the username doesn't matter and the password field is the only one that mattered.

After trying a few more, I found that `1=1` seemed to be problematic, and replacing it with `username='neuro_spike'` logged me into their account, revealing the flag: `NexusCTF{interstellar_Heist}`
