Running `file` on this image gives: `secure_transmission.jpeg: JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01, resolution (DPI), density 96x96, segment length 16, comment: "Passphrase = updc_patrol_route", baseline, precision 8, 946x949, components 3`

Clearly there's some sort of steganography with a passphrase.
`steghide extract -sf secure_transmission.jpeg -p updc_patrol_route`

Wrote `NexusCTF{updc_secure_transmission}` to `flag`
