> Polaris Logistics reports that a Beltway Bandits cell slipped a micro-payload off a freighter manifest and hid it inside a public promotional poster routed through the Quantum Nexus. Internal scans show nothing obvious: classic stego. Forensic carve leaves a “Salted__” signature and a stretched key schedule in very larger cycles on a 256-bit CBC chain. The passphrase likely rides the azure grain of the image.

> Your crew has the poster that was broadcast system-wide. Recover whatever the Bandits exfiltrated and decrypt it.
