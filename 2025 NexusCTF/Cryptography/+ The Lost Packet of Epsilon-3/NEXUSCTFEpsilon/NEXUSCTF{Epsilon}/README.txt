Recovered Transmission: Deep Net Relay Node 7A // Sector Epsilon-3

A fragmented data packet was recovered from the wreckage of a long-abandoned comms satellite.
The archive contains a single file recovered.bin which appears to be a hex encoded payload.
Multiple legacy obfuscation layers are suspected.

Good luck. Beware: not everything you find is the flag. There are decoys and false positives in this archive.
