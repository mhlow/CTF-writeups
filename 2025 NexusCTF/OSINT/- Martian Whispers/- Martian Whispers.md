> Axion Mining Corp has tasked you 🫵, dear intelligence officer, to find out what notes those PESKY MARTIANS have been passing around. Several MPLF groups have been busted after we sent out spies, and were consequently “taken care of”. However, it seems they’ve grown smart and now all their messages are a bunch of gobbledegook! Knowing them though, it’s probably some hunk-o-junk, **past-century** waffle. Well? What are you waiting for? GET LOOKING!

Possibly referring to a book? Brave new world?
