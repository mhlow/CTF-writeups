> You have been summoned by the Ætheric Order. Their instruments whisper of a disturbance hidden in the fabric of the Quantum Nexus — fragments of data flickering where no data should exist. The Order insists it is not a bug but a message, encoded in the liminal spaces between logic and illusion. To earn their favor, you must peel back the noise, reconstruct the signal, and prove that reality is only as firm as those who dare to question it.

We are given a zip file with 5 `.png` files,

> [!info]- `Never.png`
> ![[Never.png]]

> [!info]- `Stands.png`
> ![[Stands.png]]

> [!info]- `Still.png`
> ![[Still.png]]

> [!info]- `The.png`
> ![[The.png]]

> [!info]- `Truth.png`
> ![[Truth.png]]

These images all appear to be static greyscale noise.

I assume that the images have an order, specifically "The truth never stands still".

Running `pngcheck` shows no signs of corruption.

Manually inspecting the bit planes of the images shows no signs of obvious steganography.
