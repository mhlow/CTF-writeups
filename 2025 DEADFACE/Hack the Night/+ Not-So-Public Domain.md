On the announcement page there's a hint: `Hidden announcements are not displayed in this interface. Database queries may reveal additional records...`

It is embedded so there's no url spoofing to be done.

In console, it suggests `http://env01.deadface.io:8080/api/search.php?q=test&type=announcements` doing this shows this result.
